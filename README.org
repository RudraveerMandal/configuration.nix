* My configuration.nix
*** For some weird reason you decided to look at my configuration and are thinking about taking stuff from it. If you want to use it, go through it and take inspiration from it. But do not copy paste it as it needs to be personalized and will only work for me.
**** If you find something wrong in the configs, please let me know using a bug report or issue.

** NOTE: The configuration.nix wont break your system, but the configs listed here aren't completed yet.

*** Dunst is a lightweight notification utility. The changes I have made:

**** Exports the path of Node Version Manager
